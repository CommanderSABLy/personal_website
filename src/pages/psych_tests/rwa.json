    "info": "The Right Wing Authoritarianism Scale was first published in 1981 by social psychologist Bob Altemeyer. He defined a right-wing authoritarian personality as exhibiting \"a high degree of submission to the authorities, who are perceived to be established and legitimate in the society in which one lives,\" \"a general aggressiveness, directed against various persons, that is perceived to be sanctioned by established authorities,\" and \"a high degree of adherence to the social conventions that are perceived to be endorsed by society and its established authorities.\" Each of these attributes individually does not make one a right-wing authoritarian; only in combination would one be considered right-wing authoritarian. The test for this scale is based on the 1994 variant. Statements beginning with * have had their scoring altered to better reflect the nature of the scale.",
