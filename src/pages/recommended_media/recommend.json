    "tincan_rec": "This book tells the improbable story of the Battle off Samar. During the Liberation of the Philippines, task group Taffy 3 was charged with supporting the Army's landings and invasion on the Phillipine island of Leyte while Admiral Halsey took the bulk of his fleet to chase after a diversion. As a result, the outnumbered and outgunned Americans of Taffy 3 were left to fend off the largest fleet the Japanese had fielded since the Battle of Midway in June 1942. This battle is among my favorite historical tales. It's an underdog story filled with unmatched bravery that feels far too much like a Hollywood film to have actually occurred. I think that this battle is severely underappreciated with valorous acts on par with those from Normandy or Okinawa.",

    "fnv_rec": "This is my favorite game of all time. It provides ample opportunity to roleplay as nearly any type of character, a rewarding leveling system, and an intricate, morally gray world. No one is presented as \"the good guys\" and every faction is shown to have their strengths and flaws. The combat mechanics and graphics are admittedly dated, even upon it's 2010 release, and the game can be buggy on account of the Gamebryo engine. That said, this is a game I still come back to and have a blast playing every time. The game also has an incredible modding community. The randomizer mod has had me pause the game to double over laughing. I would argue this is the best post-Black Isle Fallout game."
